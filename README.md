# ECE385Final
Bomberman Final Project for ECE 385 - UIUC Spring 2023

For our final project in ECE 385, we are doing the game Bomberman as our final project. It is made up of a variety of coding structures we learned about in systemverilog throughout the semester and wraps our semester up the best way we can imagine it.
